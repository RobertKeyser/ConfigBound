# Contributing to Config-bound

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Config-bound! Here's how you can help:

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/RobertKeyser/ConfigBound.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Making Changes

1. Make your changes
2. Test your changes thoroughly. See [Testing](#testing)
3. Commit with descriptive messages, preferrably using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) format: `git commit -m "feat: feature description"`
4. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`

## Testing

It is your responsibility to thoroughly test each change and add tests as new code is added. Config-bound uses the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) framework. Test files should be titled `your-feature.spec.ts` and should be colocated with the features they describe.

### Basic usage

There are three variants of the npm test script:

- `test` - Runs tests
- `test:dev` - Runs the tests and watches for file changes
- `test:coverage` - Runs the tests and generates a coverage report

### Advanced usage

Targeting a specific group of tests:

```bash
npm run test -- --group=unit
npm run test -- --group=integration
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses Git hooks to ensure code quality. The hooks will automatically:

- Format your code using Prettier
- Lint your code using ESLint

### How it works

Config-bound uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to manage Git hooks and lint-staged to run checks only on changed files. When you commit changes:

- The pre-commit hook will run automatically
- Your staged files will be formatted and linted
- If there are any errors that can't be fixed automatically, the commit will fail

### Installing hooks

The hooks should install automatically when you run `npm install`. If you need to install them manually: `npm run prepare`

### Skipping hooks (use sparingly!)

In certain edge-case situations, you can bypass the hooks with:
`git commit -m "Your message" --no-verify`
Note: Please avoid skipping hooks unless absolutely necessary.
